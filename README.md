Autocomplete HTML5 Datalist using AJAX

Instead of adding dozens of options to a Datalist, this demo uses AJAX to provide suggestions (autocomplete ) to a Datalist while the user types in the input field.  ECMAScript 2015 (aka ES6) is used extensively, e.g. let, const, arrow function, destructuring, etc. Tested with Chrome 55, FF 50, MS Edge and Safari for iOS.
